Our roots are from North East London, in Walthamstow. We have been running a board game club in East London since 2015 and through that club a great community of gamers has developed. We succeeded in building a friendly and inclusive group of several hundred people and we hope we can do the same in Deptford over the coming years.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="about-us" class="page-section page-section--light" data-matching-link="#about-us-link"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="headline headline--centered headline--dark headline--b-margin-small">We are a brand new board game site in Deptford, South London, 10-minutes from London Bridge.</h2><h3 class="headline headline--centered headline--small headline--narrow headline--dark headline--b-margin-large">Mon / Tues Closed</h3><h3 class="headline headline--centered headline--small headline--narrow headline--dark headline--b-margin-large">Weds - Fri <strong>4pm - 9.30pm</strong><h3 class="headline headline--centered headline--small headline--narrow headline--dark headline--b-margin-large">Weekends <strong>12am - 9.30pm</strong></h3></h3></div><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="headline headline--centered headline--small headline--narrow headline--dark headline--b-margin-large">Library <strong>£5 Per Person</strong> Per Session (a normal session is 3 hours)</h3></div></div><div id="events" class="page-section page-section--no-b-padding-until-large page-section--events" data-matching-link="#events-link"><div class="wrapper wrapper--no-padding-until-large"><div class="row row--gutters row--equal-height-at-large row--gutters-small row--t-padding generic-content-container"><div class="row__large-4"><div class="events"><div class="events__photo"><img class="lazyload" sizes="160px" data-srcset="assets/images/events-games.jpg 160w" alt="Our Library"></div><h3 class="events__title">Gaming Library</h3><h4 class="events__subtitle">Stay and Play</h4><p>We have something for everyone in the library.
